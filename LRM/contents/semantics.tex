\section{Semantics}

\subsection{Types and Variables}
Every \textit{variable} in Gamma is declared with a \textit{type} and an \textit{identifier}. The typing is static and will always be known at compile time for every variable. The variable itself holds a reference to an instance of that type. At compile time, each new instantiation reserves space for one instance of that type. To be an instance of a type, an instance must be an instance of the class of the same name as that type, an instance of one of the set of descendants (i.e. a subclass defined via \verb!extends!) of that class, or the {\tt null} instance. For the purposes of function declaration, there is a special type, \textit{Void}, that allows a function to use the \verb!return! keyword without an expression.

\subsubsection{Arrays}
When specifying a type, the type can be suffixed with square brackets to indicate that it instead an array of that type. The individual instances of the array can be accesed by using the variable identifier with an index. --- I'm just not sure how to do this.

\subsection{Classes, Subclasses and Their Members}
\Lang{} is a pure object-oriented language, which means every value is an object--with the exception of the reserved references \verb!null! and \verb!this!. A class always extends another class; a class inherits all of its superclass's methods and may refine the methods of its superclass. A class must contain a constructor routine named {\tt init} and it must invoke its superclass's constructor via the super keyword -- either directly or transitively by referring to other constructors within the class. In the scope of every class, the keyword \verb!this! explicitly refers to the instance itself. Additionally, a class contains three sets of \textit{members} organized in \textit{private}, \textit{protected}, and \textit{public} sections. Members may be either variables or methods. Each class must be derived from another class as a \textit{subclass}.

\subsubsection{The Object Class}
The Object class is the superclass of the entire class hierarchy in \Lang{}. All objects directly or indirectly inherit from it and share its methods. By default, class declarations without extending explicitly are subclasses of Object.

\subsubsection{The Literal Classes}
There are several \textit{literal classes} that contain unique members that hold strictly data. These classes generally have methods developed for most operators. They are also all subclasses of Object.

\subsection{Methods}
A method is a reusable subdivision of code that takes multiple instances as arguments and returns either a variable of the type specified for the method or null. Methods of a class can have \textit{refine} statements placed in their bodies. Then subclasses must implement \textit{refinements}, special methods that are called in place of their superclass' refine statements. Optionally, the superclass can conditionally check if the refinement has been implemented to avoid runtime errors via the \verb!refinable! test.

\subsubsection{Operators}
Since all variables are classes, every operator is in truth a method called from the most precident opperand with the less precident opperand as an argument. If an operator is not usable with a certain literal class, then it will not have the method implemented as a member. Classes that are not literal classes may implement those functions so as to allow that operation to be performed between two instances of the appropriate type.

\subsection{Expressions and Statements}
The fundamental nature of an expression is that it generates a single instance. This instance may be in the form of a variable or the return value of a method. Note that the method could be in the form of an operator. If the expression is a method or operator, its arguments are, of course, other expressions. A statement can be a call to an expression, thus a method or a variable.
