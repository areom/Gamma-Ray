\subsection{Classes}
\Lang{} is a pure object-oriented language, which means almost every value here is an object, with a few exceptions like null, void and this. A class defines a set of fields and methods. A class may extend another class or subclass, and inherit or refine the methods of its superclass.

\subsubsection{The Object Class}
The Object class is the superclass of all class hierarchy in \Lang{}. All objects directly or indirectly inherit from it and share its methods. By default, class declarations without extending explicitly are subclasses of Object.

\subsection{Methods}
Method is a collection of statements to perform certain tasks. Methods can be called and re-used.
