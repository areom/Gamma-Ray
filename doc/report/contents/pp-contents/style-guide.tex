\subsection*{Ocaml Style Guide for the Development of the Ray Compiler}

Expert Ocaml technique is not expected for the development of ray, however there are some basic stylistic tendencies that are preferred at all times.

When constructing a \verb|let...in| statement, the associated in must not be alone on the final line:
\begin{lstlisting}
    let your_functor =
    	    ...
    	    ... in
\end{lstlisting}

For a large \verb|let| statement that defines a variable, store the final operational call in a dummy variable and return that dummy:
\begin{lstlisting}
    let get_x =
    	    ...
    	    let x =
    	        x_functor1 (x_functor2 y z) n in
    	    x
\end{lstlisting}

2) for the most part, try to have | (bars from match, etc) indented
I guess 3) keep records looking the way they do (fields lined up, braces not necessarily by themselves)
