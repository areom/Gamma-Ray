\subsection*{Planning Techniques}
The vast majority of all planning happened over a combination of email and google hangouts. The team experimented with a variety of communication methods. We found some success with using Glip late in our process. Zoho docs and google docs were also used without major utility.

The specification of new elements was routinely proposed via an email to all members with an example of the concept and a description of the concepts involved behind it. This proved surprisingly effective at achieving a consensis.

Development was heavily facilited through the use of a shared git repository. Topical google hangouts would be started involving all members. Team members would describe what they were working on with the immediate tasks. Any given team member could only afford to work at the same time as any one other generally, so conflicts over work were rare.

Testing suites were developed concurrently with code. Given the well-traversed nature of object oriented programming, the necessary tests were farely obvious.
