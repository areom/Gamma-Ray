I had a beginning of an idea of how OOP stuff worked underneath the hood, but this really opened my eyes up to how much work was going on.

It also taught me a lot about making design decisions, and how it's never a good idea to say ``this time we'll just use strings and marker values cause we need it done sooner than later'' -- if Algebraic Data Types are available, use them. Even if it means you 
have to go back and adjust old code because of previous ideas fall out of line with new ones.

I learned how annoying the idea of a NULL value in a typed system can be when we don't give casting as an option (something we should have thought about before), and how smart python is by having methods accept and name the implicit parameter themselves. Good 
job, GvR.

First I would like to say that this is a very cool, educational and fun project. 

One thing I learned from this project is that I take modern programming languages for granted. I enjoyed many comfortable features and syntactic sugar but never realized there is so much craziness under the hood. We had a long list of ambitious goals at the beginning. Many of them had to be given up as the project went on. From parsing to code generation, I faced a lot of design decisions that I did not even know existed. I gained a much better understanding of how programming languages work and why they are designed the way they are. Also, now I have a completely refreshed view when I see posts titled "Java vs. C++" on the Internet.

Another thing I learned is that proper task division, time management and effective communication are extremely important for a team project. Doing things in parallel and communicating smoothly can save you a lot of trouble.

Finally, I learned my first functional programming language OCaml and I do like it, though I still feel it's weird sometimes.

Advice for future groups:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Start early and procrastinate less
  \item Have a team leader and communicate better
  \item Enjoy it
\end{itemize}
