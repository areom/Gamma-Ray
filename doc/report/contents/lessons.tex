I had a beginning of an idea of how OOP stuff worked underneath the hood, but this really opened my eyes up to how much work was going on.

It also taught me a lot about making design decisions, and how it's never a good idea to say ``this time we'll just use strings and marker values cause we need it done sooner than later'' -- if Algebraic Data Types are available, use them. Even if it means you 
have to go back and adjust old code because of previous ideas fall out of line with new ones.
