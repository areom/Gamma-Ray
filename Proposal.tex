\section*{Why \Lang{} -- or Why Update \OLang{}?}
\OLang{} is a programming language of the ``Scandanvian School'' of Object
orientation. The language provided two primary beneficial features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \OLang{} Pattern is used as a unifying concept for every element
of the program -- Classes, Procedures, anonymous Objects, etc.
\item Refinement and specialization is used instead of overriding to
ensure that super-pattern behavior is respected by sub-patterns. A
simple way analogy to understand this is to think how you would program
in Java if all your methods had to be declared \emph{abstract} or
\emph{final}. \OLang{} just provides this structuring and a little help to
make it easier to use.
\end{enumerate}

A consequence of the fact that patterns are refined and everything is a
pattern is that classes can have nested classes and \emph{those} nested
classes can themselves be refined; classes can be \emph{virtual} in the
sense of virtual functions, etc in other languages.

The primary negative about \OLang{} however is that the syntax is horrible
-- absolutely atrocious. While the language provides a nice theoretical
setting for object oriented development given it's pro's, the fact that
the syntax is such a significant con clearly more than negates any of
the benefits. In a world where LISP, the most beautiful language, is
derided for its parentheses, a language like \OLang{} simply cannot succeed
where Python, Ruby, and other easy to read languages exist.

And so this is the goal of the \Lang{} programing language project; to
make a new language with a feature set similar to what \OLang{} provides
but with a readable syntax that is programmer friendly.
