test types:
  * Brace  -- these should be with {, }, and ;
  * Mixed1 -- these should be mixed (closer to Space for now)
  * Space  -- these should be with :

in each type there are test folders:
  * Empty   -- structurally empty tests
  * Trivial -- just above empty, should do something... trivial
  * Simple  -- some basic programs, more than just trivial

each test type requires the same tests. at the end, the outputs are compared
